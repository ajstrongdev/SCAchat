# SCAchat - A self-hosted chatting application

SCAchat (SCA Chatting Application) is a self-hosted chatting application similar to AOL Instant Messenger. The chatting application is privacy-respecting and does not store any messages or user-data. Once a session has ended, all messages are gone.

SCAchat is not hosted anywhere centrally, rather you can independantly host your own instance of Chadachat by utilising the code.

```sh
sudo apt install nodejs npm
